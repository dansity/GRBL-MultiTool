Do you hate to open Fusion360 just to generate gcode for two holes? I don't know about you, but I do hate that.
I wanted it to work like on "big guy's" machines where you have "canned cycles" - predefined scripts embedded into Gcode where you can quickly spit out basic operations. This is not only convenient but converts your CNC mill or router into a "fast use" tool that you can reach to. Makes a difference in the workshop.

### PROJECT IS METRIC
However, you are more than welcome to remix it to imperial. Shouldn't be hard.

### DISCLAIMER
It is easy to crash your machine in a thousand ways. Please always do dry runs if you are not familiar with gcode. I cannot take responsibility for what your machine does with this gcode.  
If you download this project you accept this simple term.

### Currently supported operations:

- Facing / Skimming
- Rectangular pocket

Project is made using HTML and Javascript.
